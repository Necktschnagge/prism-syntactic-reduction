Warning: "Pmin=?" and "Pmax=?" operators are identical to "P=?" for DTMCs/CTMCs

Prob0: 22 iterations in 0.01 seconds (average 0.000227, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 405, no = 0, maybe = 0

Results (including zeros) for filter "init":
0:(0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,0,0)=1.0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.007 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
